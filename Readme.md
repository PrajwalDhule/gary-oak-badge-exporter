# 🎖️ Gary Oak Badge Exporter

This is a fun web-based tool that lets you recreate Gary Oak’s iconic badge showcase — but with your own custom set of tech badges or icons. Select from a dropdown of logos (like ChatGPT, TypeScript, Neovim, etc.) or upload your own images. Once done, you can export the final badge image as a PNG.
